      <h3>BRIEF HISTORY</h3>
      <p class="about-paragraphs">
        Christian Liberation Int'l Churches is the church arm of Christian Liberation Ministries International Incorporated
        and was founded to carry out the vision of reminding the world of the eminent second coming of our Lord Jesus Christ
        and prepare them for His coming. This vision was born out of a series of revelations our founding bishop, Archbishop
        Sylvanus Ofili had with the Lord in which rapture was shown to him on three occasions. One of which was in October
        1994 where God showed him a vision in which our Lord Jesus Christ finally came and nobody was ready for his coming.
        The Lord then commanded him with a loud voice saying, "You have told the world of my coming but have not prepared them
        for my coming. Now go and prepare them for my coming." In obedience to this heavenly vision, Christian Liberation Int'l
        Churches was inaugurated on the 5th of February 1995 in Suleja, Niger state, Nigeria.

             Our commission is directed to the "Nations of the North". The northern part of Nigeria was given to us by the Lord
             as our Jerusalem from where we are to spread "to the uttermost parts of the world". In pursuance of this mandate the
             church has a missionary arm with strong focus on towns and villages in the northern part of Nigeria.

            <ul class="church-vision-mission">

              <li>We believe that both the old and the new Testaments of the bible were written by the inspiration of the
              Holy Spirit. We take the bible as final authorithy in all matters concerning christian conduct and work.</li>
              <li>We believe that there is only one God, as revealed unto us by the bible, who is the creator of both visible
              and invisible things.</li>
              <li>We believe in the trinity; God the Father, Son and the Holy Spirit.</li>
              <li>We believe Jesus Christ is the son of God. We believe in the Lordship of Jesus, that he took away our sins and
              he is the Savior of the world.</li>
              <li>We believe in the baptism of the Holy Spirit with the outward manifestation of speaking in tongues and the
                demonstration of its powers.</li>
              <li>We believe in divine healings and miracles and that heaven is the final dwelling place of all saints.</li>
              <li>We believe in rapture of the church at the second coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.</li>
