            I used to have severe pains in my back which had defied all medical treatment. This pain had been
            restraining me from doing so many things. During one of our Sunday services, the servant of God
            Bishop Sylvanus Ofili, gave a word of knowledge on what I was passing through and declared divine
            healing upon my life. I believed God and He granted me healing.
            I dont feel the pain anymore since that day. I want to return all glory to God. Hallelujah!

            I want to return all glory to God for preservation of life. I had invited my younger sister who had been suffering
            from fibroid to one of our Liberation Night programme. Unknowingly to me, she had already begun contemplating suicide
            as a result of depression. She really was on the verge of killing herself. During the ministeration the woman
            of God, Rev. (Mrs) Ofili, declared that there was someone present that was planning to commit suicide and asked
            that the person concerned should come out for prayers. I was surprised, and very much afraid, to see my sister walking out
            to the front. After the woman of God prayed for her I believed by faith that she had been delievered from that
            suicidal spirit. And since then she no longer is depressed. She also had a successful fibroid operation.
            To God be the Glory!

            I thank God for delivering me from the hands of "one-chance" robbers and ritualists. That faithful day
            I had set out for my business and boarded a taxi from Jabi to Area 1. On getting to a lonely stretch of
            road, the "passengers" and driver dispossessed me of my money then handed me over to another group of men
            who promptly dragged me into a nearby bush. They proceeded to strip me naked and after making
            incantations for several minutes one of them brought out a knife and was proceeding to cut off my breasts
            when suddenly, the one who seemed to be their leader called out to him to stop saying my breasts were not the
            type they needed. The others were insisting that they still cut them off anyways but the leader was adamant
            and eventually they let me go. Praise the Lord!

            One morning, while cooking, I had to hurriedly go out and I to forgot put to switch off my gas. I did
            not return home till late at night to discover that the food was bunrt black with the gas still on, but
            miraculously there was no fire outbreak. From the state of my kitchen I know this could only be by the finger
            of God. Another time, I needed to travel for a burial in the village but
            unlike other times something kept whispering that I will die in this journey. I really became afraid but
            because it was a journey I had to undertake, I met separately with some of our branch pastors to agree with
            me in prayers for a successful journey. A lot of things happened in that journey but I want to return glory
            to God for success of the burial and safety back home.

            I want to return all glory to the God of Liberation for healing my daughter of kidney failure. After going to many
            hospitals with no help in sight, we eventually ended up at specialist hospital Gwalagwalada where the doctors told
            us that the chances of survival of this sickness was 50/50. My daughter started undergoing dialysis treatment.
            Aside the financial burden, a lot of blood was needed and even the church members were not left out both in donating
            blood, visitation, and more importantly prayers for healing. Today we are thanking God that my daughter is totally
            healed from this terrible sickness, and I will like to appreciate the church for all the love and support given.
            Indeed by His stripes we are healed. Praise be the Lord!
